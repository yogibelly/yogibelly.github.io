                    <p class="text-muted">We love butter chicken from Indian restaurants too, but this is about something different: our priority is on healthy Indian food you could eat everyday.  You will be surprised to see how much more there is to Indian cuisine than what you find at Indian restaurants. We hope to help you discover how people really eat in a culture rooted in the longest tradition of vegetarian cooking.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Are you running out of ideas for what to cook when trying to eat less meat? With YogiBelly you will get to try a variety of new vegetarian dishes: pumpkin, black chick peas, squash, stuffed mini-eggplant, edo, lotus root, bitter melon, lentil kebabs in tart tumeric curry,... and more. All our food is 100% vegetarian (no eggs either). Many of our dishes are also vegan. (caveat: we only serve Tuesdays and Wednesdays for now)</p>
