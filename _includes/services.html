                    <p class="text-muted">We have always struggled in getting our kids to eat a varied healthy diet, that wasn't just chicken and bagels. What's more, we always strive to reduce our consumption of meat, but are often stuck in our meal planning with the North American tradition of a main course of meat, surrounded by some vegetables...or pasta. All our food is 100% vegetarian (no eggs either). Many of our dishes are also vegan.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Although Ayurvedic principles are ingrained in Indian cuisine, most of the food served in Indian restaurants does not represent this ancient system of well-being. Our food is inspired by Ayurveda (Ayur = life, Veda = Science): no refined foods, no white sugar, no garlic or onion and no meat.</p>
